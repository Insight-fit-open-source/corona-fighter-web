You have the potential to make this pandemic so much worse.\n\nThat’s because the coronavirus is both more contagious and more deadly than the common flu. One person can easily transmit it to other people without knowing it, and those people would then transmit it to even more people, creating a terrifying snowball effect.\n\nThe good news is, just as you can easily transmit the virus to other people, you can easily avoid transmitting it — if you’re willing to stay home. That’s right: Simply by sitting on your couch, you can potentially save lives.\n\nTo see why, check out the visualisation below. It shows how one person with the coronavirus, who passes on the virus to three other people (some experts say three is the average, though others estimate the infectiousness is a bit lower), can very quickly spawn a public health nightmare that afflicts thousands of people. But it also shows how one person can mitigate that effect through social distancing. By adhering to the lockdown, and avoiding the office, the barbecue, the airport, and so on, an individual can deprive the virus of the opportunity to infect more people.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LjO__hZRS-oGvRzcOLcjUh-OCMJ2YJOEMa1FyXDrltNjye1Tf8Z9Kn6u7BoJLfBy1G72LsabEElL_ekgIlcmL75VOITfrvyGpLZpu8SToxKnjlKi9AuK0R1vhcGu-OhbO0i3ecM =624x375)\n\nSource: [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/26/21193851/coronavirus-covid-19-staying-home-social-distancing)",

ACFS are putting together weekly food hampers to ensure at risk children have at least essential foodstuffs in the home.\n* [**Donate perishables to Ladles of Love to keep support their soup kitchens**](http://ladlesoflove.org.za) - Vital items include perishable foods such as canned food, maize meal, oil, and pulses like beans and lentils. Bars of soap, and small bottles of sanitiser, that homeless people can keep in a pocket, will also be hugely beneficial.\n* [**Donate goods to CoronaCare for South Africa**](https://www.solidarityfund.co.za/) - CoronaCare is a match-making platform, connecting concerned South Africans with organisations on the ground supporting those in need. Those wishing to contribute can do so either through cash donations via this crowdfunding page, or through dropping off goods at one of their designated spots.

Many, such as politician Phumzile Van Damme, have urged employers to help by allowing domestic workers and gardeners to stay home with full pay."
