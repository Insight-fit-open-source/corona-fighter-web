Below are several ways you can assist in helping to keep South Africa safe.\n\n## **Stay at Home**\n\nIf you think you don’t have a huge role to play in how the coronavirus outbreak plays out, think again. You have the potential to make this pandemic so much worse.\n\nThat’s because the coronavirus is both more contagious and more deadly than the common flu. One person can easily transmit it to other people without knowing it, and those people would then transmit it to even more people, creating a terrifying snowball effect.\n\nThe good news is, just as you can easily transmit the virus to other people, you can easily avoid transmitting it — if you’re willing to stay home. That’s right: Simply by sitting on your couch, you can potentially save lives.\n\nTo see why, check out the visualisation below. It shows how one person with the coronavirus, who passes on the virus to three other people (some experts say three is the average, though others estimate the infectiousness is a bit lower), can very quickly spawn a public health nightmare that afflicts thousands of people. But it also shows how one person can mitigate that effect through social distancing. By adhering to the lockdown, and avoiding the office, the barbecue, the airport, and so on, an individual can deprive the virus of the opportunity to infect more people."
