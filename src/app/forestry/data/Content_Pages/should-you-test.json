      "content": "**Why should I not be tested for coronavirus disease if I am concerned but have no symptoms?**\n\nThere are a number of reasons why we do not recommend testing of a person with no symptoms, even if you are a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, or have recently travelled to a country where COVID-19 is circulating in the community:\n\nA negative test result in a person with no symptoms does not mean that you do not have COVID-19. You could still be in the early stage of COVID-19 and develop symptoms later. Therefore, testing when you do not have symptoms could give a false-negative result.\n\nEven if your laboratory test result was negative, you would still need to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days if you travelled to a region with high transmission or had close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19. Refer to guidance on what to do if I am a close contact of a person with confirmed disease and am asked to home quarantine.\n\nIf you tested negative and mistakenly interpreted this to mean that you were not infected, you could go back to your usual activities and spread the virus while you still had an early infection.\n\nThere is a shortage of laboratory tests globally, and we need to reserve our valuable laboratory testing resources for those who are sick and for those groups of people where we can use these test results for public health good.\n\nhave a look at our guidelines to see [how to stay safe](/how-to-stay-safe \"How to stay safe\"), and [how you can help.](/how-to-help \"how to help\")"

      "content": "**I have some symptoms, why can't I be tested?**\n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or fever.  However, these are also symptoms of the flu and don’t necessarily mean that you have COVID-19. The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) recommends that you should only get tested if you display certain symptoms and also satisfy one or more of the below:\n\n* Have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient;\n* Have travelled to a high-risk country;\n* Have worked in or been to a healthcare facility treating people with COVID-19.\n* Have a severe case of pneumonia with an unknown cause.\n\nCheck-in with us at least daily and we will inform you as soon as testing or medical care is recommended."
