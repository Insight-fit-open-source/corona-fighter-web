      "content": "### Why should I not be tested for COVID-19 if I am concerned but have no symptoms?\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the NICD does not recommend testing of a person with no symptoms, even if you are a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case, or have recently travelled to a country where COVID-19 is circulating in the community:\n\n* A negative test result in a person with no symptoms does not mean that you do not have COVID-19. You could still be in the early stage of COVID-19 and develop symptoms later. Therefore, testing when you do not have symptoms could give a false-negative result.\n* Even if your laboratory test result was negative, you would still need to stay at home in quarantine for 14 days if you travelled to a region with high transmission or had close contact with a person with confirmed COVID-19.\n* If you tested negative and mistakenly interpreted this to mean that you were not infected, you could go back to your usual activities and spread the virus while you still had an early infection.\n* There is a shortage of laboratory tests globally, and we need to reserve our valuable laboratory testing resources for those who are sick and for those groups of people where we can use these test results for public health good. It is safer for you and everyone else to only test when necessary.\n\nhave a look at our guidelines to see [how to stay safe](/how-to-stay-safe \"How to stay safe\"), and [how you can help.](/how-to-help \"how to help\")"

      "content": "### I have some symptoms, can I be tested?\n\nThe symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, sore throat, shortness of breath or fever. If you have sudden onset of any of these four symptoms, you should be tested. Testing as many symptomatic people as possible is vital to slowing transmission of the virus. If you only have other symptoms such as headache, nausea or loss of smell then you should not be tested but rather monitor your symptoms daily and test only if you develop one of the symptoms above. Importantly, all of the symptoms may be seen in other illnesses such as the seasonal flu and having symptoms doesn’t necessarily mean that you have COVID-19. \n\n  \nIn summary, The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) recommends that you should only get tested if you have sudden onset of one of the following four symptoms:\n\n* Cough\n* Sore throat\n* Shortness of breath\n* Fever or history of fever\n\n    \n  Check-in with us at least daily and we will inform you as soon as testing or medical care is recommended."
